<h3>UnityTestProject</h3>

<p align="justify">
This is a place to track progress of my Unity learning journey. I won't be making the project itself public because of the paid assets I'm using, so instead I'm planning to use this page as a devlog-style showcase of implemented features and skills I learn along the way, possibly posting some of my own code & assets in the future.

My only previous expirience with Unity amounts to short 2-week uni cource where I began to develop this game as an exam project. So here's where my game stands as of now - at the beginning of my personal learning expirience.
