# UnityTestProject

This is a place to track progress of my Unity learning journey. I won't be making the project itself public because of the paid assets I'm using, so instead I'm planning to use this page as a devlog-style showcase of implemented features and skills I learn along the way, possibly posting some of my own code & assets in the future.
